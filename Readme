Fully committed to life-long learning. I am a full stack developer with a deep passion for solving problems. Capable and with the unique skillset of using creativity and logic to solve comprehensive puzzels through code. When not drinking coffee and spending long hours at a computer, I like to stay fit with Mixed Martial arts like Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and Boxing.
